# End-to-end regression test for the magic-link auth + role-gating scheme
# introduced in migrations 20260705090000-20260705090400.
#
# What this proves, against the REAL linked Supabase project (not a local
# stub):
#   1. A real magic-link sign-in creates a crew_members row via the
#      on_auth_user_created trigger, with role=field_staff / active=true /
#      company_id=Keywest Asphalt / auth_user_id linked.
#   2. The crew_members_restrict_update trigger blocks a field_staff user
#      from self-promoting to coordinator.
#   3. The reconstruction_runs role gate blocks a field_staff user from
#      accepting a run, and allows a coordinator to.
#
# Why part of this is manual: step 1 requires actually clicking the emailed
# magic link. There is no way to automate that without the service_role key
# (e.g. via the Admin API's generate_link), which this project deliberately
# keeps out of client code and out of this repo. Steps 2-3 use a synthetic
# second account created directly via SQL (no email needed), so they run
# fully unattended.
#
# The script cleans up everything it creates (the synthetic account, the
# throwaway project/job/segment/runs) and restores TEST_EMAIL's role to
# whatever it was before the run, so it's safe to re-run repeatedly — e.g.
# after any future RLS/trigger/auth change — without leaving residue in the
# live project.
#
# Usage:
#   TEST_EMAIL=you@example.com ./scripts/test-role-gating.sh
#
# Requirements:
#   - supabase CLI installed, logged in, and linked to the target project
#     (supabase link --project-ref <ref>)
#   - .env.local in the repo root with VITE_SUPABASE_URL and
#     VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY set (used only to call the public /auth/v1/otp
#     endpoint — no service_role key is used anywhere in this script)
