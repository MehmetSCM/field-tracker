/**
 * A field app that stays open all day is exactly the case a stale PWA
 * service-worker cache bites hardest — silently working against old code
 * until someone happens to hard-refresh. registerType is 'prompt', not
 * 'autoUpdate' (see vite.config.ts), specifically so a new service worker
 * waits for this instead of taking over in the background on its own.
 *
 * Renders nothing until needRefresh flips true. Tapping the banner calls
 * updateServiceWorker(), which sends the waiting worker a skip-waiting
 * message — the actual reload is handled by the controllerchange listener
 * below, not by the library's own internal reload wiring. That internal
 * path (workbox-window's 'controlling' event) only reloads when its
 * isUpdate flag is true, and that flag is captured once, at this page's
 * original service-worker registration — Boolean(navigator.serviceWorker.
 * controller) at that exact moment. If this tab happened to be the one
 * that registered the very first service worker (no controller existed
 * yet), isUpdate is permanently false for the rest of this tab's session,
 * silently skipping the reload on every later update. Confirmed live: a
 * tab that started with no prior service worker correctly showed this
 * banner on a later deploy, but tapping it never reloaded until this
 * listener was added. navigator.serviceWorker.oncontrollerchange is the
 * unconditional, standard signal instead — it fires whenever control
 * actually changes hands, regardless of that stale flag.
