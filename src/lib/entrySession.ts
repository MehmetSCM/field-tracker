// Local-first, per-(activity, project, direction) entry-session state — same
// localStorage-backed pattern as profile.ts. Survives navigating away and
// back, closing and reopening the tab, and going offline/online (all pure
// localStorage reads/writes, nothing network-dependent). Only cleared by an
// explicit clearEntrySession call (the "End session" action) — never by
// navigation, app restart, or a connectivity change.
//
// Keyed by activity ('milling', later 'paving') + project + physical
// direction (NB/SB/etc), NOT by road_segment_id — the active segment can
// change mid-session (auto-detected from the station as the crew crosses a
// segment boundary) while the walk itself continues uninterrupted, so it's
// tracked as a field WITHIN the session rather than being the session's key.
// Two independent sessions (different activities, or the same activity on
// two different project/direction combinations) never collide or overwrite
// each other.
